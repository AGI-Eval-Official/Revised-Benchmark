# Public Benchmark - Revised Version
When using certain public benchmarks, we discovered errors in their official answers, which may compromise fair comparisons between agents. We manually fixed these benchmarks and documented our fixes in this repository.

## BrowseComp-ZH
For browsecomp-zh, we have corrected the answers for 24 problems. `answer` and `raw_answer` correspond to the corrected and original answers, respectively. We provide the specific reasons for the corrections in the `reason` field and use `answer_diff` to identify the modified data. 

The revised benchmark is `./benchmarks/browsecomp-zh.jsonl`, the following is a demo:
```json
{
    "problem": "某歌手出生于中国北方，20岁开始音乐创作，28岁推出第3张个人专辑，专辑名5个字，且带数字。2015年前后，为某音乐综艺冠军担当编曲及制作，第二年为某电影制作的同名主题曲发布。问他举办婚礼的日期",
    "raw_answer": "金志文",
    "answer": "2012/11/23",
    "fix_reason": "Q问题是婚礼日期，原答案为举办婚礼的人",
    "answer_diff": true
}
```
